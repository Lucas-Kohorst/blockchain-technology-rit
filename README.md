Drama is the only literary art that requires an extra step to come to full expression. Playwrights, unlike the novelists or poets, create their work to be performed by others. In this course, students will read a selection of plays and discuss questions of historical relevance, reception, and ask why this form of literature has been so enduring and socially potent                                                                                                                                                                                                       |Taken      |General Education|Prerequisite                     |

Prior to enrollment in this course the student must submit a research proposal to the proposed faculty sponsor and the economics department for approval. Once approved, the faculty sponsor in consultation with the student will determine the number of credit hours (1-3) which will be assigned for the course. The completed research project will be presented at the annual COLA Undergraduate Research Conference                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |Considering|Math and Macro   |Economics                        |
|ECON 411      |Computational Economics                     |3.0    |The objective of the course is to introduce students to computational modeling in economics. The course is intended for students who wish to learn what role computation can play in economics, how to create computational models for studying economic phenomena, and how to use these computational economic models to draw insights into economic phenomena. We will use programming languages such as Julia, Python and R for modeling and analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |To Take    |Math and Macro   |Economics                        |
|ECON 431      |Monetary Analysis and Policy                |3.0    |This course is a study of monetary behavior and the role of monetary institutions in the modern economy. The primary focus of the course is upon understanding how money plays a role in individual decision making units (i.e., households and businesses) and ultimately affects the macroeconomy (e.g., output, employment and inflation). The first part of the course begins with a discussion of economic methodology including introduction to regression analysis and an overview of money and the financial system; the course then proceeds to a discussion of interest rates, portfolio analysis and exchange rates. The second part of the course considers how money affects the macroeconomy by discussing the money supply process and considering theories which explain how changes in the money supply affect the economy.                        |To Take    |Math and Macro   |Economics                        |
|ECON 410      |Game Theory with Economic Applications      |3.0    |Game theory uses a mathematical approach to study situations of strategic interdependence, i.e., situations with two or more players in which each player's decision influences payoffs of other players and players are aware of this fact when making their decisions. Game theory has been applied to understand diverse economic, political and biological phenomena. We will study how to formulate situations of strategic interdependence as game theoretic models; how to explain/predict behavior of the parties involved, through the use of various equilibrium concepts; and/or identify guidelines for appropriate behavior. The concepts and methods will be illustrated with many examples. The objective is to introduce you to language of game theory and its methodology, and to develop analytical reasoning skills                             |To Take    |Math and Macro   |Economic Theory                  |
